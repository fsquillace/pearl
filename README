NAME
----
pyshell - An Enhanced Bash Shell Framework

SYNOPSIS
--------
*source* *<path/to/pyshell>/pyshell* 

*bash --rcfile <path/to/pyshell>/pyshell*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*pyshell* is an enhanced and lightweight shell framework in Python that allow
to get better the use of the shell Bash GNU/Linux and automate many daily
activities of the system administrator.

*pyshell* configures several bash shell options, aliases that helps to improve
the experience of using the shell. The next sections show all the options and
aliases enabled in *pyshell*.

*pyshell* also configures three important configurations files vimrc, bashrc,
inputrc. In particular, vimrc applies a sequence of key bindings for built-in
functions and main plugins. Finally, bashrc is used to startup *pyshell* and
inputrc extremely simplify the way of typing the commands. 

INSTALLATION
------------
Once you extracted the .tar.gz file, type:
-------------------------------
$ cd pyshell
$ source pyshell/pyshell
-------------------------------

If you are using *pyshell* for the first time you probably do not have the
configuration directory in '$$~$$/.config/.pyshell'.
If so, *pyshell* create the configuration directory and apply some modification
of your config file appending a 'source' in .vimrc, .bashrc and .inputrc (do not
worry you have just to uncomment them if you do not want any of these features ;))

NO ROOT PERMISSION (SVN REPOSITORY)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you do not have root permission, you can directly install *pyshell* by the
svn repository. Type the following commands:
.................................
$ cd '$HOME'
$ svn checkout 'http://pyshell.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/' '.'
$ source pyshell/pyshell
.................................

You can install *pyshell* in other place different from your home.

When opening a new terminal the sequence of script that are sourced is the following:
	. '.bashrc'::
	*pyshell* append a new line in '.bashrc' in order to startup *pyshell* once a terminal is opened.
	. 'pyshell'
	*pyshell* introduce every alias, variable and script that the commands need for the correct execution.
	. 'pyshellrc'::
	Contains all the configuration that you need to set after the execution of *pyshell*.
	This can be useful when you want directly edit some alias, variable or script of *pyshell*.  

CONFIGURATIONS
--------------
*pyshell* applies several new configuration for vim, bash and inputrc. This
operation allows to get better experience of your shell. 

Vimrc
~~~~~
*pyshell* introduces a sourcing into your own .vimrc file configuration at the
end of the file. You can just uncomment it if you do not want this *pyshell*
feature.
This configuration allow to have all the functionality you need in 
This is particular useful when you want to type file in remote server so as
having all the feature you are used to. Here is a small list of the
feature enabled in VIM:

*Highlights and autocompletion::
    For java, python, javascript, html, css, c/c++,xml and more..
*Smart Home*::
    The key 'Home' has the special power of moving the cursor to the
    first character of the line;
*Indent Folding*::
    Allows to use folding when the file is indented. Use 'za' to toggle 
    a fold it's the only command worth it;
*Moving among windows*::
    - *Up* -> 'Cntrl+k'
    - *Down* -> 'Cntrl+j'
    - *Left* -> 'Cntrl+h'
    - *Right* -> 'Cntrl+l'
*Resizing current window*::
    - *Increase vertically* -> '+'
    - *Decrease vertically* -> '-'
    - *Increase horizontally* -> '>'
    - *Decrease vertically* -> '<'
    - *Maximize* -> '_'
*Spelling*::
    - *Select Language* -> '\ol'
    - *Select spell file* -> '\of'
    - *Correct word* -> '\os' or 'Cntrl+x s' (in insert mode)
    - *Remove spelling* -> '\or'
    - *Add word in dict* -> '\oa'
    - *Go to next error* -> '\on'
    - *Go to previous error* -> '\op'
*Search and replace*::
    - *Search and replace* -> '\r'
*File choosers*::
    - *Explore* -> '\e'
    - *Ranger* -> '\o'
*Session*::
    - *New session* -> '\sa' (automatically saved in ~/.vim/sessions)
    - *Open session* -> '\so'
    - *Remove session* -> '\sr'
*Nerd Commenter*
    - *Comment* -> 'Cntrl-,'
*TaskList*::
    - *View task window* -> '\t'
*TagList*::
    - *View outline window* -> '\p'
*Buffer explorer*::
    - *Select buffer* -> '\b'
    - *Open vertical window* -> '\v'
    - *Open horizontal window* -> '\h'

To get improved the VIM configuration you have to install some
optional plugins:

*Nerd Commenter*::
    To comment lines for all file types;
*TaskList*::
    Look for TODOs in the current file;
*TagList*::
    It's an outline for all the signature of function,
    class,etc;
*Buffer Explorer*::
    Allow easily to change between buffers;
*Super Tab*::
    Integrate all the VIM feature using only the TAB key;
*PyLint*::
    Analyzes Python code looking for bugs;
*PyFlakes*::
    Vim plugin which highlights common Python errors;
*PyDiction*::
    For a list of keyword in Python.

Bashrc
~~~~~~
*pyshell* introduces a sourcing into your own .bashrc file configuration at the
end of the file. You can just uncomment it if you do not want this *pyshell*
feature.

In this way *pyshell* automatically startup when opening a new shell.

Inputrc
~~~~~~~
*pyshell* introduces a sourcing into your own '.inputrc' file configuration at the
end of the file. You can just uncomment it if you do not want this *pyshell*
feature.
The most important feature applied with inputrc are:

    - Case insensitive typing directories;
    - Typing the prefix of an old command you will get the entire command once
      typing the up arrow.

Ranger/commands.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*pyshell* introduces a sourcing into the config file of ranger commands.py
There are several commands for ranger that *pyshell* introduces:

*:trash*::
    Move to trash the selected files
*:trash* [*-s* || *--show*]::
    Show the trash
*:trash* [*-e* || *--empty*]::
    Empty the trash

*:sync*::
    Sync the selected files
*:sync* [*-s* || *--show*]::
    Show the sync directory
Allows to sync the files selected copying them into the SYNC_HOME specified
in $$~$$/.config/pyshell/pyshellrc. For more details see the SYNC section
below.

*:symc*::
    Create symlinks of the selected files into sync directory
*:usymc*::
    Remove the symlinks of the selected files
*:symc* [*-s* || *--show*]::
    Show the sync directory
Allows to sync the files selected creating symlinks instead of copying them 
into the SYNC_HOME specified in $$~$$/.config/pyshell/pyshellrc.
For more details see the SYMC section below.

*:extracthere*::
    Extract the files contained into the selected compress file.

*:compress* 'FILE.EXT'::
    Compress the selected files into FILE.EXT where EXT can be any compress
    extension (.tar.gz .zip .rar ...).

COMMANDS
--------
Here there is a list of the most important commands of *pyshell*. There are
also other useful commands for Archlinux such as:
*pacaur*::
    Very small program similar to yaourt.
*paclist*::
    Lists all the installed package ordered by the size or the installation
    date.

Please, check out in the 'bin' directory of *pyshell* root directory to see
all the available commands.

CD/CD2
~~~~~~
Allows to list all your favorite bookmark paths. It is aliased in the classical
cd built-in command. Type *cd --help* to see all the available options.

Example of using:

    *$ cd -g* 4::
    Changes to the directory in the fourth entry.

    *$ cd*::
    Lists all the entries.

    *$ cd -a* .::
    Adds the current directory into the table.

    *$ cd -r* 4::
    Removes the fourth entry.

Integration with Ranger application
CD stores the entries in '$$~$$/.config/ranger/bookmark' to be integrated with
Ranger. So, if you add an entry directly with ranger you will see it in cd
command too.

TODO
~~~~
Allows recursively to search for TODOs inside every files in the directories
specified by the user. It is also possible to add new generics TODOs in the
default file. Type *todo --help* to see all the available options.

Example of using:

    *$ todo*::
    Lists the generics TODOs and the TODOs contained into every files in the
    directories specified by the user.

    *$ todo* 'This is a new TODO'::
    Adds a new TODO into the default file.

    *$ todo -r* 'NUM'::
    Removes the TODO specified by the user.

    *$ todo -a* '<new/path>'::
    Adds a new path to look for TODOs.

    *$ todo -l*::
    Lists the available paths.

    *$ todo -d* 'NUM'::
    Removes the paths specified by the entry.


Integration with Ranger and Remind application
TODO stores TODOs the entries into '$$~$$/reminders' to be integrated with Remind.
So, you can see the same TODOs in Remind too. TODO also stores all the scan
paths in '$$~$$/.config/ranger/bookmark' to be integrated with Ranger. The user can
sign a directory to be scanned for TODOs directly from ranger program by
marking the directory (using the command ':m') with a digit from 0 to 9.

CMD
~~~
Allows to list your own favorite commands. Type *cmd --help* to see all the
available options.

Example of using:

    *$ cmd*::
    Lists all the commands

    *$ cmd -a* "ls -l" "This is the corresponding comment"::
    Adds a new command

    *$ cmd* 'NUM'::
    Stores the corresponding command specified by the entry. Then, you just
    need to type Cntrl-h to put it in the command line. 

MAN2
~~~~
MAN2 is a minimal manual to get essentials snippet information about all the
important commands. In man2.conf you can specify the path or url where is
located the source manual.
Type *man2 --help* to see all the available options.

Example of using:

    *$ man2* 'keyword'::
    Search "keyword" into the db.

EYE
~~~
EYE searches (also recursively) if substrings match with the specified pattern, 
into each text or pdf file.

Example of using:

    *$ eye -r* . "python"::
    Searches recursively into the current directory the text files which contain the
    word "python"

    *$ eye -r -p* . "python"::
    Same as above but also search for pdf files.

    *$ eye -r -c*  . "Line-[0-9]+"::
    Same as above but matching using a regular expression and case sensitive.
    For example, the string "Line-235" matchs with the regex above.

SYNC
~~~~
SYNC is an awesome command that allows you to synchronize your data
using a synchronization system such as Dropbox/Ubuntu One in a very fashion
way. You need to install rsync to use this command.
SYNC build the same filesystem structure starting from the sync directory
specified by the environment variable '$SYNC_HOME'. For instance, if you want to
sync the file '$$~$$/.bashrc' it will be copied in '$SYNC_HOME/$$~$$/.bashrc' by rsync
command. rsync allows to create a perfect mirror updating the sync directory
with only the modified files.

Like to rsync you can exclude some files or directories that match with a
pattern. For example if you don't want sync makefiles:
------------------------------------------------
sync --exclude=Makefile --exclude=makefile mydir
------------------------------------------------

In '$$~$$/.pyshell/pyshellrc' you can specify your sync directory in the environment
variable '$SYNC_HOME' (to default is '$$~$$/Dropbox').

You could change the variable every time by setting '$SYNC_HOME'. For example,
you can synchronize files or directory directly on another remote machine:
----------------------------------
$ export SYNC_HOME=user@domain.com:
$ sync . '/home/user/myfile'
----------------------------------
NOTE: Don't forget to use *colon* if you specify a machine location.
See sync --help to know all the details of how using this command.

Example of using:

    *$ sync* /home/david/ /etc/::
    Synchronizes all the files in the '/home/david' and '/etc/' respectively into
    '$SYNC_HOME/home/david' and '$SYNC_HOME/etc'.

SYMC
~~~~
SYMC is still better than SYNC! It allows you to synchronize your data
using a synchronization system such as Dropbox/Ubuntu One in a very fashion
way but creating symlinks of the files instead of copying them.
SYMC build the same filesystem structure starting from the sync directory
specified by the environment variable '$SYNC_HOME'. For instance, if you want to
sync the file '$$~$$/.bashrc' it will be copied in '$SYNC_HOME/$$~$$/.bashrc' by cp
command. When updating/removing your files, they will be automatically synchronized 
by your sync system so that you don't need to sync manually every time and you won't 
lose your data anymore!

In '$$~$$/.pyshell/pyshellrc' you can specify your sync directory in the environment
variable '$SYNC_HOME' (to default is '$$~$$/Dropbox').
See symc --help to know all the details of how using this command.

Example of using:

    *$ symc* /home/david/ /etc/::
    Synchronizes all the files in the '/home/david' and '/etc/' respectively into
    '$SYNC_HOME/home/david' and '$SYNC_HOME/etc' creating symlinks.


BACKUP
~~~~~~
BACKUP command makes sessions of backup including files and directories.
Each backup can be sent to a mailbox by specifying the account credentials
into your config file. The config file is located in
'$$~$$/.config/pyshell/etc/backup.conf'. If it doesn't exist the program BACKUP will
find backup.conf in the etc directory of pyshell root (to default is
'/opt/pyshell/etc/backup.conf').
It's possible to create several sessions instead of using only one config
file. Moreover, you can create files directly in a directory called 'backup.d'
and recall them by the BACKUP program to apply backups of the corresponding
file and directories reported into the session.
The backup will be stored according to the variable 'bkp_dir' specified into
backup.conf file (to default the directory is '$$~$$/.config/pyshell/backups').
See backup --help to know all the details of how using this command.

Example of using:
    *$ backup -s*::
    Lists all the sessions created by the user in 'etc/backup.d' directory.

    *$ backup*::
    Applies a backup for the main session in 'backup.conf' file. The backup
    will be stored in 'bkp_dir'.

    *$ backup -m mysession1*::
    Applies a backup of the session contained in 'backup.d/mysession1' and
    send an email attaching it.

BASH OPTIONS
------------
*cdspell*::
    Minor  errors  in  the  spelling  of  a
    directory  component  in  a  cd command will be
    corrected.
*autocd*::
    A command name that is the  name  of  a
    directory  is  executed as if it were the 
    argument to the cd command.
*dirspell*::
    Bash attempts  spelling  correction  on
    directory  names  during word completion if the
    directory  name  initially  supplied  does  not
    exist.
*histappend*::
    The history list  is  appended  to  the
    file  named  by the value of the 'HISTFILE' 
    variable when the shell exits,  rather  than
    overwriting the file.
*checkwinsize*::
    Check the window size after each command and,
    if necessary, update the values of LINES 
    and COLUMNS.


MAIN ALIASES
------------
    - *~* - is your Home
    - *q*=exit
    - *f*=fg
    - *b*=bg
    - *j*=jobs
    - *l*="ls -h --color"
    - *ll*="l -l"

    - *goo*=ping www.google.com
    - *isconnect* - check whether the computer is connected
    - *alert* - send a notification alert

TIPS & TRICKS
-------------
DEFAULT PERMISSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you create a new file or directory it will get some default permissions.
You will be the owner. Your default group will be used as the group. And the
mode will normally be world readable or private depending on your umask. The
following values make sense for a umask:

[width="15%"]
|=================================
|umask |file mode  |directory mode
|0022  |-rw-r--r-- |drwxr-xr-x
|0077  |-rw------- |drwx------
|=================================
*pyshell* uses the '0022'. For security reasons you can use '0077'.
If you do not want '0022', you can specify the other in 
'$$~$$/.config/pyshellrc' by typing: *umask* '0077'


REMOVING FILES WITH TRASH COMMAND
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*pyshell* provides an useful command that allows moving to a trash directory
unneeded files instead of removing directly them using rm command. The
interface used is the same of the command implemented in ranger by *pyshell*.
Each shell creates its own trash directory located in
$$~$$/.config/.pyshell/tmp/`tty`. The command trash will make a backup of each
existing destination file or directory.
Usage:

    *$ trash* 'FILE1' 'FILE2' ...::
    Move the files into trash

    *$ trash* [*-s* || *--show*]::
    Show the trash

    *$ trash* [*-e* || *--empty*]::
    Empty the trash

The trash directory will be removed when exiting from the shell.

BIND FOR RANGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cntrl-o starts ranger command


CHANGING DIRECTORY EXITING FROM RANGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a function that allows to change automatically the directory as soon
as the user quit from ranger programm. Note that you can return to the original
directory by typing "cd -".

RANGER FILE CHOOSER IN VIM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of using the Explorer of Vim to select files in the filysystem, you can
even use ranger. In particular, when you type \o you will see an instance of
ranger that allow you to select files. See all the functionality of *pyshell*
for Vim in the Vim configuration section.

BOOT GRAPHICAL APPLICATION AT STARTUP OF X SEVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can specify in your ~/.xinitrc your applications you want to startup
with some delay with the following bash function:
-----------------------------------
source /path/to/pyshell/lib/misc.sh
bootapp pidgin 23
-----------------------------------
It will boot pidgin after 23 seconds. This function allow to reduce the
overhead of booting the X Server with a lot of application at startup.


CONFIG FILES
------------
The config files touched by *pyshell* are:

* '$$~$$/.config/ranger/commands.py'
* '$$~$$/.bashrc'
* '$$~$$/.vimrc'
* '$$~$$/.inputrc'

FILES
-----
*pyshell* creates a config directory in '$$~$$/.config/pyshell' which include 
several config files. All the temporary directories of the associated shell 
are stored in '$$~$$/.config/pyshell/tmp'.

The bookmark paths are stored into '$$~$$/.config/ranger/bookmarks'. The TODOs 
are stored into '$$~$$/.reminders'.
